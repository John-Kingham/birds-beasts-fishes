# Birds, Beasts and Fishes

Birds, Beasts and Fishes is a command line word game for children of (almost) all ages.

It is based on a chalk-and-slate game of the same name, described in Alice Gommeâ€™s 1894 book, The Traditional Games of England, Scotland and Ireland.

The game is similar to the more popular Hangman game. The player is given a word with all of the letters blanked out, except for the first and last letter. The player guesses either single letters or the whole word, with the aim being to guess the word in as few guesses as possible.

As the title suggests, all words are the names of birds, beasts or fishes (or animals more generally). In addition to just being fun, the game aims to get more children interested in the natural world, animals, language and the joy of solving puzzles.
